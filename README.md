# CoderDojo Map Reactions App

The Android App we built during a workshop at the [CoderDojo Linz](https://linz.coderdojo.net/) that was held together with [Matthias](https://github.com/kadhonn/).

It is a very simple app where the user can input a phrase, which is phonetically mapped to a list of places that sound similar. That list is displayed as a route on a map.

The backend for this app can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/KatharinaSick/xkcd-map-reactions).
